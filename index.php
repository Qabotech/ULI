                <h3>
                    Islam and Christianity have a lot of similarities starting with believing that Mary was a virgin
                    also that Jesus was born miraculously, they also both believe in the day of judgment which leads to
                    either paradise or hell (but There are some differences between how the day of judgment looks like)
                    and they revere the early prophets including Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Joseph, John the Baptist
                    and even Jesus (Peace be upon all of them).
                    but there are also disagreements between them like the fact that Muslims don't believe that Jesus is
                    the son of god or god or that he had been crucified.
                    Also, Christians don't believe in prophet Mohammed<a>(ﷺ)<sup>*</sup><span>Peace be upon
                            him</span></a>.
                    but the <a>Quran<sup>*</sup> <span>Holy Book Of Islam</span></a> always commands Muslims to
                    respect other people from different religions.
